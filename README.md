# Pretty Console
Prettifying the browser console with a new console method - making it easier to read and the argument type immediately clear.
Available for free on the Chrome store shortly.

## Usage
-   Find and add the Chrome extension to your browser.
-   A script runs on load and binds a new method to the console object.
-   Use 'console.p()' as if it were 'console.log()';
-   Switch back to log or trace etc. for specific debugging.
-   Your console printing will now be a little more pleasing :]

## To-do
-   Add full colour scheme support
-   Possible object improvements
