# Pretty Console
Prettifying the browser console with a new console method - making it easier to read and the argument type immediately clear.

-   Use 'console.p()' as if it were 'console.log()';
-   Displays your passed argument in a clearer, colour-coded fashion.
-   Switch back to log or trace etc. for more specific debugging.
-   Default colour scheme provided in colourScheme.js - edit to choose your own.
-   Repo is set-up as a chrome extension but not published.
